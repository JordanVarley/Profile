# About me

Hello! my name is Jordan Varley, I work as a Website Admin and i'm currently doing a JAMStack course so I can learn new things to help the company I work for.

I currently have very very little knowledge of coding! but i'm hoping the JAMStack course I'm doing will change that and i'll learn a lot from it.

## My Current job

As a website Admin for the company I work for, we use WordPress for creating pages/interactive games and some pages have coding on, but all I do is copy and paste info into the coding so I've only seen basic coding.
